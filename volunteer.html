    <h1>Community Service/Volunteer Work</h1>
    <p>I have done lots of community service/volunteer work due to National Honor Society (NHS) and Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (JROTC). Practically anything from Thanksgiving meal service to highway cleanups. 
        However, none really relate to my field of study.<br></p>
    <p>The only volunteer work that is the closest to relating to my major is being part of the tech team for the JROTC Leadership and Academic Bowl (JLAB).
    As part of the tech team, we were responsible for and worked with the cameras, microphones, lights, sounds, speakers, and some competition equipment.
