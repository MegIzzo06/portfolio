    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="black and white me.jpg">
    <p> My name is Megan Izzo. I am a student at the University of Advancing Technology. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree. 
        My major is Robotics and Embedded Systems. When I can, I wish to declare a second major in Network Security.<br></p>
    <p> Ever since I was a little girl, I have always had a curiosity and fascination with robots. I have always loved building and creating things. 
        I also enjoy programming. Yes, it can be stressful, but the feeling of content, excitement, relief, and satisfaction that one gets when 
        they have figured out how to program something or fix a program problem is one of the best.<br></p>
    <p>My hobbies include crochecting, knitting, reading, building objects out of LEGOs, and doing anything crafty.</p>
