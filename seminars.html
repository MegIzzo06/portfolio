    <h2>National Youth Leadership Forum: Engineering</h2>
    <p>A week long engineering program that taught us critical thinking, creative thinking, electrical engineering, some programming, and the 17 sustainable development goals.<br>
        We worked in teams of 3-5 to get our projects done. The main task throughout the week was to come up with an invention that related to 3 or more 
        sustainable development goals and to work as a team to come up with the function, design, budget, materials list, and other details.
