    <h1>Education</h1>
    <h2>College</h2>
    <p>I am currently attending the University of Advancing Technology. My major is robotics and embedded systems.
        I am in my first year. I am planning on dual majoring in network security when I can declare it.</p>
    <h2>High School</h2>
    <p>I attended high school at Tombstone High School. I graduated in the top 5 of my class. I was in the National Honor Society (NHS) from Sophmore year to Senior year. In my Senior year, I was NHS president. 
        As president I helped my membes get all of their group hours and individual hours in by accepting and creating community service oportunities within the school and community.<br>
        I was also the S-1 (paperwork person) in Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (JROTC) my Senior year. Because of that experience, I am now well versed in secretarial work, organization, and Micrsoft Office.</p>
